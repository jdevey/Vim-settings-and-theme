Colorscheme:
To get the color scheme installed for vim, add it to the vim80/colors
directory, then comment out the line in desert.vim that says:
hi Normal	guifg=White guibg=black

You also need to go into the vimrc and make the colorscheme line say:
colorscheme perun

Plugins:
Go to ~\.vim\pack\vendor\start\ then run git clone <url> for the plugin
