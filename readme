Colorscheme:
To get the color scheme installed for vim, add it to the vim90/colors
directory, then comment out the line in desert.vim that says:
hi Normal	guifg=#ffffff guibg = #333333

or something similar. This may differ depending on the os and the version of vim.

You also need to go into the vimrc and make the colorscheme line say:
colorscheme perun
